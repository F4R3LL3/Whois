#Whoisf By F4R3LL3 ===========


Very Basic whois Client Using Socket Server


The idea for this project is to show a simple method for using socet server to communicate with whois servers.

no repository requirements, simple make executable and execute with required commands. 
e.g.

./whoisf.py -i origin AS3333
OR
python whoisf.py -i origin AS3333


This will execute command, 

whois -h whois.ripe.net -i origin AS3333
